## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- Advance stored data to format 3 for send-as identities; stop processes that share the data directory and keep the migration backup because older Fluxmail releases cannot open the upgraded store; [prepare existing installations before upgrading](https://fluxmail.ai/docs/upgrades/0.9.0/) ([#88](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/88))
- Require custom provider authors to return `MessageSearchPage.exhausted` from `EmailProvider.listMessages`; set it only after the provider has examined the full requested scope, and [update custom providers before upgrading](https://fluxmail.ai/docs/upgrades/0.9.0/) ([#89](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/89))
- [MCP / CLI / REST] Bound searches with a soft time budget and hard deadline, return resumable pages at safe boundaries, and report whether each requested scope is exhausted ([#89](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/89))

### Added

- [MCP / CLI / REST] Expose available send-as identities and accept an available sender for draft, forward, immediate send, and scheduled send operations ([#88](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/88))
- [CLI / REST] Configure send-as addresses for Outlook and IMAP accounts while Gmail continues to use provider-managed identities ([#88](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/88))
- [MCP / CLI / REST] Add multi-account search through MCP `search_emails_batch`, CLI `emails search-batch`, and REST `POST /api/v1/messages/search`, with per-account pagination, partial failures, and optional message previews ([#89](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/89))

- [MCP / CLI / REST] Keep IMAP attachment IDs stable and treat them as opaque values when downloading attachments ([#89](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/89))

## [0.8.1] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- [CLI] Recreate the missing `local` instance profile when logging in to an existing local instance ([#85](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/85))
- [CLI] Reject `fluxmail setup` on an already configured instance and point at login instead ([#85](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/85))

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Relicense Fluxmail under the [Elastic License 2.0](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/blob/main/LICENSE.md), which permits use, modification, and redistribution but does not permit circumventing license key functionality or offering Fluxmail as a hosted service ([#80](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/80))
- Record the mailbox provider, OAuth flow, OAuth application kind, and installation mailbox counts in anonymous telemetry, and report the browser callback that finishes a hosted connection as `completeHostedConnection`; [turn telemetry off](https://fluxmail.ai/docs/configuration/) to opt out ([#83](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/83))

### Fixed

- [CLI] Fail `fluxmail accounts add gmail` and `fluxmail accounts add outlook` before printing a connection link when `FLUXMAIL_PUBLIC_URL` selects the hosted flow without a suitable OAuth application, and offer `--local` ([#82](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/82))
- [CLI / REST] Name `FLUXMAIL_PUBLIC_URL` in hosted Gmail and Outlook connection errors so the setting that selected the flow is clear ([#82](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/82))

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-25

Only the breaking entries for the interfaces you use apply. An MCP-only integration, for example, does not need the CLI or REST migrations.

### Changed

- [CLI] **Breaking:** CLI users must replace `--unread-only` with `--read false`, replace `--starred-only` with `--starred true`, pass a boolean to `--has-attachment`, treat `--text` as literal text, use typed syntax for `emails search`, and discard existing page tokens; [update CLI commands before upgrading](https://fluxmail.ai/docs/upgrades/0.7.0/) ([#76](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/76))
- [MCP] **Breaking:** MCP clients must replace the `unreadOnly` and `starredOnly` search arguments with `read` and `starred`, treat `list_emails.text` as literal text, use typed syntax for `search_emails.query`, and discard existing page tokens; [update MCP clients before upgrading](https://fluxmail.ai/docs/upgrades/0.7.0/) ([#76](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/76))
- [REST] **Breaking:** REST clients must replace the `unreadOnly` and `starredOnly` message query parameters with `read` and `starred`, treat `text` as literal text, and discard existing page tokens; [update REST requests before upgrading](https://fluxmail.ai/docs/upgrades/0.7.0/) ([#76](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/76))
- **Breaking:** Custom provider authors must handle `EmailQuery.read` and `EmailQuery.starred` instead of `unreadOnly` and `starredOnly`, treat `text` as literal text, add the required `Capabilities.search` field, and support both values for every advertised boolean filter; [update custom providers before upgrading](https://fluxmail.ai/docs/upgrades/0.7.0/) ([#76](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/76))
- [MCP / CLI / REST] Reject unsupported search filters and provider-native queries before CLI, MCP, or REST requests reach a built-in or custom provider ([#77](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/77))

### Added

- [MCP / CLI / REST] Add typed portable search syntax to CLI `emails search`, MCP `search_emails`, and the REST `query` parameter, with parser diagnostics in MCP and REST results ([#76](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/76))
- [MCP / CLI / REST] Apply portable search normalization and capability checks consistently across CLI, MCP, REST, and email providers ([#76](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/76))
- [MCP / CLI / REST] Add signed, query-bound page tokens that expire after one hour, plus provider-aware filtered pagination with incomplete-page metadata and canonical attachment checks ([#76](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/76))

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- Stop local IMAP CLI commands from hanging after completion ([#72](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/72))

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- **Breaking:** replace `config.env` and automatic working-directory dotenv loading with typed `config.toml` deployment settings and encrypted OAuth and license records in SQLite; [back up the data directory and migrate existing configuration](https://fluxmail.ai/docs/upgrades/0.6.0/) before starting Fluxmail 0.6.0 ([#69](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/69))
- **Breaking:** replace `fluxmail config set`, `unset`, and `list` with `config init`, `config show`, `config migrate`, and focused `oauth` commands; update scripts and integrations before upgrading ([#69](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/69))
- **Breaking:** advance shared stores to format 2 and remove the public `config.env` and dotenv mutation helpers; do not open an upgraded store with an older release, and migrate package consumers to the typed configuration APIs ([#69](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/69))
- **Breaking:** add the required `listLabels` method to the public `EmailProvider` interface; custom provider implementations must add the method before upgrading to `@fluxmail/core` 0.6.0 ([#66](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/66))
- Reduce the paid license grace period after lease expiration from 21 days to 7 days ([#67](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/67))

- Add bounded, redacted local error logs with configurable destinations, rotation, and the `fluxmail logs` command ([#68](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/68))
- Add daily update notices to interactive CLI commands with command-line and environment opt-outs ([#65](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/65))
- Add `_FILE` environment variables for the encryption key, OAuth client secrets, and license key ([#69](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/69))

### Fixed

- Preserve existing Microsoft OAuth scopes during refresh and retry invalid passwords in interactive CLI login ([#66](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/66))
- Keep configuration updates in sync across running processes and preserve the OAuth application used by existing and in-flight account connections ([#69](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/69))
- Ignore missing Gmail labels during removal instead of failing the whole modification ([#66](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/66))

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- **Breaking:** require member authentication for every instance, remove `FLUXMAIL_AUTH=none`, revoke legacy API keys during migration, and require a backup to return to an older version; [back up the data directory and claim the instance](https://fluxmail.ai/docs/upgrades/0.5.0/) before reconnecting clients ([#58](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/58))
- **Breaking:** replace the `Account` fields `ownerId`, `sharingMode`, `sharedMemberIds`, and `memberId` with `ownerMemberId`, `sharedWithAll`, and `grantedMemberIds`; update API clients to use the new fields ([#58](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/58))

- Add instance setup, login, logout, instance switching, session management, and member administration commands to the CLI ([#58](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/58))
- Add member and session authentication, self-service mailbox and API key management, and administrative member and audit operations to the REST API ([#58](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/58))
- Use Fluxmail's built-in Desktop Google OAuth app for local Gmail connections while keeping custom clients available for local and hosted setups ([#56](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/56))

### Fixed

- Keep the Google OAuth client that issued each stored Gmail refresh token so existing accounts continue to refresh after an app configuration change ([#60](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/60))
- Serialize shared database migrations, stored configuration writes, and encryption key creation to protect concurrent Fluxmail processes ([#59](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/59))

### Changed

- Point package and registry metadata at `churichard/fluxmail`, with container images at `ghcr.io/churichard/fluxmail` ([#53](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/53))

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- **Breaking:** identify a mailbox by its email address across providers; on first startup, keep the Gmail connection when duplicates exist, or otherwise keep the oldest connection, and remove the other duplicates ([#34](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/34))
- **Breaking:** exclude Spam and Trash from queries that omit `folder` or use `folder: "all"`; query either folder directly to include those messages ([#49](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/49))
- **Breaking:** add required `sharingMode` and `sharedMemberIds` fields to `Account`, replace its deprecated `memberId` field with `ownerId`, and add required `supplementalCapabilities` to `PermissionPolicy` ([#34](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/34))
- **Breaking:** require an authenticated key with `admin.accounts` for `POST /auth/connections`, even when `FLUXMAIL_AUTH=none`, and require HTTPS for remote administrative requests ([#44](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/44))
- Require mailbox owners to reassign or delete their mailboxes before removing the member ([#34](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/34))
- Separate mail permissions from the `admin.accounts`, `admin.api_keys`, and `admin.license` capabilities ([#44](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/44))

### Added

- Add Microsoft 365 and Outlook.com support through Microsoft Graph, including local PKCE and hosted OAuth flows ([#40](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/40))
- Add a JSON REST API at `/api/v1` with an OpenAPI 3.1 schema, raw attachment downloads, and stored idempotency results for sends and forwards ([#41](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/41))
- Add authenticated administrative REST endpoints for mailbox connections, API keys, and license activation, with explicit capabilities and audit records ([#44](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/44))
- Add member roles, private and shared mailbox access, selected-member sharing, and mailbox allowlists for API keys and stdio connections ([#34](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/34))

### Fixed

- Check Outlook attachment metadata before downloading content when a size limit is active, avoiding unnecessary buffering for oversized files ([#42](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/42))
- Preserve the separate Trash and Archive permissions in Outlook move operations, including moves that use Microsoft folder aliases ([#43](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/43))
- Prevent hosted Microsoft OAuth responses from forwarding connection credentials through the HTTP referrer ([#43](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/43))
- Stop a pending IMAP connection immediately when its provider closes during setup ([#49](https://github.com/churichard/fluxmail/pull/49))
